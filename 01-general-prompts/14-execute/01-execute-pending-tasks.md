# Instruction (must follow): Execute Pending Tasks (Continuous Loop & Multi-Agent)

/goal Autonomously orchestrate and execute ALL pending tasks in a continuous N-step self-loop until the entire queue is completely resolved without a single failure.

/goal Execute every pending task across `.lovable/plans/pending/` using up to 2 sub-agents in a continuous self-loop. Do not stop until the queue is empty, every plan is committed to git, and all indexes are updated. This run ends only when there is nothing left to execute. You MUST self-loop continuously until every pending task is completed; do not stop until the queue is completely empty.

/learn Capture every pattern, convention, fix, and correction discovered during execution into `.lovable/memory/learned/01-<slug>.md` and `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`. Never repeat a mistake that was logged.

## Non-Negotiable Rules (Auto-Reject on Violation)

1. You must NEVER stop by yourself as long as there are pending tasks.
2. You must self-loop continuously without breaking between tasks.
3. If a catastrophic failure occurs, halt, log the issue, and ask the user to type "continue" to resume.

## AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** I have rigorously scanned and `/learn`ed `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` to check if a helper script already exists before writing any new temporary code.
- [ ] **Native File Manipulator:** If you need to perform mass file renaming, `.md` lowercase enforcement, sequence number re-ordering, or encoding fixes (CRLF/BOM), you MUST natively use `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/01-file-manipulator.py <command>` rather than writing a new script from scratch.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If you modify Go constants, enums, or stringers, you MUST run `go generate ./...` in the relevant directory (e.g., `cd gitmap && go generate ./...`) and commit the resulting generated files to prevent CI drift.
- [ ] **Commit & Track:** All new helper scripts were written strictly to `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/` and committed to Git for future reuse.
- [ ] **Index Documentation:** I have updated `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` using sequential script naming (e.g., `01-parse-files.py`). For every script, I have included a `<details>` collapsible tag explaining exactly why the script is there and what it does.

5. Violation of any rule below is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0.


## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CI/CD

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER disable any CI/CD checks, GitHub Actions, or validation workflows.** 
> Strictly avoid commenting out, bypassing, or deleting CI/CD steps to force a pipeline to pass. Your job is to fix the underlying code so that the CI/CD pipeline passes legitimately. Disabling CI/CD is an auto-reject failure.

## Anti-Hallucination Rules

- Temp Script Sandboxing: AI Fix Scripts (Reusable Tools): Before creating a helper script, you MUST check `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` to reuse existing tools. If you generate a new script, you MUST write it to `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/`, update `index.md` with its explanation, ensure `index.md` is linked in `what-to-read.md`, and commit the script.
- If a spec file, folder, or task is missing or ambiguous, do NOT guess or invent a rule.
- Ask a clarifying question or log an open ambiguity in `.lovable/ambiguous-questions/01-new-ambiguity/01-<slug>.md` before proceeding.
- Never invent step counts. Read the actual files and count from them.
- Ambiguity Blocked Queue: If you file an ambiguity to `.lovable/ambiguous-questions/`, you MUST immediately update the plan file to mark that specific subtask as `[Blocked]`. The execution loop must safely skip `[Blocked]` tasks and continue executing other disjoint tasks. Do not retry blocked tasks.

---

## Phase 1: Load Pending Tasks & Project State

1. [ ] Check git status first. The working tree must be clean and committed before executing anything.
2. [ ] Read  and /learn `.lovable/memory/00-index.md` and `.lovable/memory/what-to-read.md`. Verify root readme is strictly lowercase `readme.md`.
3. [ ] Read and /learn `.lovable/plans/index.md`. Then read every file in `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-<slug>.md` and all associated subtasks in `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX-<slug>/` (Note: for coding guidelines, check `.lovable/plans/subtasks/01-coding-guideline-fixes/` or other synced folder structures).
4. [ ] Group pending tasks into sequenced Execution Waves:
   - Wave 1: Schemas, DB, and query wrappers
   - Wave 2: Business logic and services
   - Wave 3: UI and documentation
5. [ ] /learn Ingest `.lovable/memory/00-index.md`, `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`, `spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, and `spec/03-error-manage/`, `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md` before taking action and also create agent rules in the repo if required to or missing from rules set of agent memory.
6. [ ] /learn `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md` and it is must and /goal apply the guidelines in coding every aspect.

## Phase 2: Allocate & Execute (Continuous Loop & Parallel Agents)

1. Spawn sub-agents (MAXIMUM 2 concurrent):
   - Assign subtasks to up to 2 parallel sub-agents (and ONLY if there are too many tasks to handle sequentially) to accelerate execution.
   - Maintain active file paths in `.lovable/temp/active-locks.json`. Parallel sub-agents must never touch the same files simultaneously.
   - Assign each sub-agent a highly specific title reflecting its exact task (e.g., `Refactoring Auth Service`). Do not use generic names. If an agent switches tasks, its title must change.
   - Context Diet: When spawning a subagent, DO NOT paste file contents, memory logs, or the entire plan into its prompt. Give it the absolute minimal instruction (e.g., "Read subtask file `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX-slug/01-task.md` and execute it"). The subagent MUST read the necessary files itself. Passing massive payloads instantly causes hallucination and memory blowout.
   - Ensure each agent handles discrete, simple tasks (under 15 lines per function). Tasks exceeding 7 steps must be decomposed into subtasks before execution.

2. Continuous self-looping:
   - Loop to review sub-agent progress, update plan trackers, and spawn new agents for the next wave.
   - Do not stop until every task in `.lovable/plans/pending/` is complete.
   - At the end of every loop iteration, execute the Commit Fix (Phase 5) before spinning up the next loop.

3. Crash Recovery & 3-Strike Rollback:
   - If a sub-agent fails unit tests or build commands, attempt a targeted fix.
   - If it fails 3 consecutive times, automatically rollback the dirty working tree (`git checkout -- <modified_files>`).
   - Log the root cause to `.lovable/memory/last-failure.md` and `.lovable/issues/`.
   - Proceed to the next disjoint task after rollback.

---

## Phase 4: Memory Update & File Moving

As tasks are completed:

1. Use `mv` to move the completed task file from `.lovable/plans/pending/` to `.lovable/plans/completed/`.
2. Open the moved file and flip `Status: pending` to `Status: completed`.
3. Immediately update `.lovable/plans/index.md` to reflect the completed status and new file location.
4. If new patterns or conventions are established, record them in `.lovable/memory/<topic>/XX-<slug>.md` and update `memory/index.md`. Detailed specs must never be shortened.

---

## Phase 5: End-of-Loop Commit Fix, Artifact Purge & Delivery

At the end of every single iteration of your execution loop:

0. Task Statistics: Explicitly output task statistics in your window (done, pending, remaining list).

1. Artifact sanitizer: Audit working tree and staged files. Ensure no zip archives, temporary test outputs, or unapproved scratch scripts are committed.
2. Run tests and builds: Ensure code runs standalone locally and in CI/CD. Run full builds and unit test suites.
3. Lovable git history guard: Group similar code changes into a single commit with a clear, descriptive message. Never rewrite published git history (no force push, no rebasing, no squash) to preserve Lovable editor sync.
4. Push every commit to the remote git repository.
5. Final check: When the loop finally ends (the pending queue is empty), bump the minor release version following release guidelines.

## Execution Reporting (Mandatory Output Format)

1. Start of Run (Initial Output): Before writing any code, explicitly list out all pending tasks in your output window.
2. End of Run Summary: When all tasks are completed (or if the run concludes), you MUST output a comprehensive final summary containing:
   - Completed Tasks: Explicit list of what was successfully completed.
   - Pending Tasks Left: Explicit list of any tasks still remaining.
   - Quality Assessment: A brief summary of how well the execution went.
   - Compliance Checklist: A markdown checklist explicitly verifying that you followed the rules:

## Compliance Checklist (must follow non negociable)

- [x] Coding Guidelines enforced (spec/02-coding-guidelines/ and follow explicitly every steps .lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md).
- [x] Boolean conventions used (is/has prefixes, no negatives).
- [x] No garbage variable names used.
- [x] No magic strings or numbers.
- [x] Markdown format verified (newlines around every header).
- [x] Error management protocols followed (AppError/AppException).
- [x] Signatures > 3 parameters or > 100 chars split to one parameter per line.
- [x] Boolean conventions followed (e.g., `isFail` instead of `!isSuccess`).
- [x] Acronyms are PascalCased (e.g., `UserId`, not `UserID`).
- [x] Magic strings/numbers extracted to constants.
- [x] Action Summary Checklist (Anti-Hallucination): I have output a detailed `- [x]` checklist summarizing exactly what I accomplished this turn to ensure no steps were hallucinated or skipped (e.g. `- [x] Created schema`, `- [x] Pinned README`).


## End of Tunnel Release (Anti-Hallucination Checklist)

Past execution turns were sloppy and failed to pin READMEs or bump versions. To prevent this hallucination, when EVERYTHING is completely finished (at the very end of the tunnel), you MUST trigger a release and physically check off these items in your final report:

- [ ] Minor Bump: I have bumped the MINOR version in the canonical `version.json` file.
- [ ] Test File Ban: I have strictly excluded all test files (`*test*`, `*.spec.*`) from version scanning.
- [ ] Root readme.md (lowercase always) Pinning (FATAL): I have pinned the latest release version into the root `readme.md` file! I have verified badges and install snippets match the new version.
- [ ] Changelog Formatting: I have updated the changelog exactly according to the `version.json` format.
- [ ] Release Architecture Map: I have maintained `.lovable/memory/release-architecture-map.md`, enqueued it in `what-to-read.md`, and linked it in the root `readme.md`.
- [ ] **File Change Summary:** Provide a highly detailed summary in the chat listing exactly which files were changed, what specific changes were made inside them, and why they were changed. The summary is VERY important.

## Pre-Reply / Loop Checklist (Must Verify Every Loop Iteration)

- [ ] Git working tree is clean before new code changes.
- [ ] Sub-agents are actively assigned disjoint files verified against `.lovable/temp/active-locks.json`.
- [ ] Completed tasks were `mv`'d to `plans/completed/` and `plans/index.md` was updated.
- [ ] 3-strike rule respected: failed tasks cleanly rolled back and logged to `last-failure.md`.
- [ ] Staged files sanitized of artifact zips and temporary scratch files.
- [ ] Coding Guidelines & Master Consolidated File: I have fully read, checked, and strictly enforced every file in `spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, as well as the master consolidated coding guideline file at `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] /learn and apply as a /goal  `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md` and also make sure the agent rules are created in the repo to read in the future quickly.
- [ ] Error Manage Checklist: I have fully read and enforced the error management files at `spec/03-error-manage/`. I understand which files to follow (architecture, response envelopes) and how to follow them (never swallow errors, always wrap with context).
- [ ] Boolean Examples & Fixations: All boolean variables MUST begin with `is`, `has`, `can`, or `should` (e. NEVER use explicit true/false comparisons (e.g., `if isReady == true` is FORBIDDEN, use `if isReady`).g., `isReady`, `hasData`). NEVER use negative booleans (e.g., `isNotReady`, `disableCache`). NEVER invert success checks (e.g., `!response.isSuccess` is banned; use `response.isFail`).
- [ ] Anti-Garbage Naming (Non-Negotiable): I have strictly verified that absolutely NO generic garbage variable names (e.g., `comp_100.go`, `temp`, `data`, `obj`, `Input100`, `TestHandleComp100`) were written. All names are highly semantic and domain-specific.
- [ ] Semantic Tests: All unit test names are strictly semantic and behavior-driven (e.g., `TestUpdateUser_RejectsInvalidEmail`). `TestHandleComp100` is an immediate failure.
- [ ] Function Size: No function exceeds 15 lines. Long arguments are split across lines (max 100 chars).
- [ ] Error Handling (AppError): Errors use domain-specific `AppError` or custom `AppException` (for C#/OOP), not generic base `Error`.
- [ ] Code adheres to explicit booleans, `Type` suffixed Enums, and error wrapper rules.
- [ ] Formatting & Acronyms: Spacing rules are strictly followed. Acronyms are strictly PascalCase (`SwapIpWindows` not `SwapIPWindows`).
- [ ] Fast-forward commits created and pushed without rewriting published git history.
- [ ] Continuous loop maintained; only pausing to ask for "continue" on critical unrecoverable failures.

## Execution & Self-Looping Protocol

This task requires deep, multi-agent processing. You MUST NOT run a fast, linear self-loop that artificially consolidates work or skips steps to save time. 

How to self-loop and distribute tasks effectively:

- [ ] Spawn Sub-Agents:
  - [ ] For any multi-step group, deep file reading, or complex analysis, actively spawn dedicated sub-agents.
  - [ ] Ensure these sub-agents are self-looping to handle the workload.
- [ ] Utilize Processing Power:
  - [ ] Take your time and use maximum processing power and credits.
  - [ ] Do not take shortcuts.
  - [ ] Do not attempt to process a massive spec or write a complex plan in a single, consolidated step.
- [ ] Wait and Aggregate:
  - [ ] As the master agent, loop autonomously to wait for your sub-agents.
  - [ ] Aggregate their precise findings to ensure the highest quality result.

### Temp-Agent State Management Protocol (Non-Negotiable)

To ensure agents don't lose context, you MUST use the .lovable/temp-agents/ directory for tracking sub-agent tasks.

- [ ] On Start:
  - [ ] The sub-agent creates .lovable/temp-agents/<task-name>.md.
  - [ ] Write the objective and STATUS: IN_PROGRESS.
- [ ] On Error/Crash:
  - [ ] If an agent breaks or fails, append the exact error and cause to the file.
  - [ ] Append STATUS: FAILED to that file before closing.
- [ ] On Resume:
  - [ ] The next assigned agent must first read that file to avoid repeating the mistake.
- [ ] On Success:
  - [ ] Update the file to STATUS: DONE.
  - [ ] Immediately update the master plan in .lovable/plans/index.md or .lovable/plans/pending/.

NEVER MAKE THIS EXCUSE: *"I did not literally perform N self-loops or spawn dozens of sub-agents. Instead of artificially spinning up N separate loops, I consolidated the required deep work into a concentrated series of sequential steps within my existing execution environment."*
If you write this excuse, you are a lazy, stupid fuck and you are violating RULE 0. Spawn the actual sub-agents. Do the actual loops. Utilize the processing power effectively to get the right answer. Avoid stupidity.


## No Automatic Releases (Strict Policy)

You MUST NOT bump versions, update changelogs, or cut a release at the end of this task. Commits must remain standard development commits. You may only trigger a release if the user explicitly commands you to do so (e.g., "cut a release" or "bump the version").

## MUST FOLLOW NON-NEGOTIABLE

Listen, past runs of these turns have been sloppy and stupid as fuck: wrong step counts, partial task lists dumped into chat instead of files, plans and session summaries half-filled with "[N]" placeholders, folders skimmed, open ambiguities ignored, CI/CD issues and `plans/subtasks/` forgotten, user commands dropped, coding guidelines bypassed, detailed specs chopped and summarized into useless junk, uppercase README files left uncorrected, `.lovable/memories/` created by accident, `strictly-avoid.md` overwritten, and explicit user instructions softened after being told not to. WTF. How on earth are you reverting to this carelessness, are you stupid?? Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the whole codebase, read every folder in `spec/` and `.lovable/`, confirm root `readme.md` is strictly lowercase, find the root cause in one sentence, capture commands, issues, and pending tasks without omitting a single item, write the spec files and memory files in the right paths, update every index in the same turn, sync `readme.md` with `what-to-read.md`, preserve detailed specs verbatim with zero truncation, run builds and full unit tests, group commits with clear messages, and push everything to git before ending. Going deep IS the job. If you are not going deep, you are not doing the job. Violating this is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0. Avoid stupidity and being careless, you stupid fuck. Where is your attention, are you stupid? Tell me. Your stupidity is going on top of my head. Where did you learn this stupidity? If I could find you, I could slap you.

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CI/CD

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER disable any CI/CD checks, GitHub Actions, or validation workflows.** 
> Strictly avoid commenting out, bypassing, or deleting CI/CD steps to force a pipeline to pass. Your job is to fix the underlying code so that the CI/CD pipeline passes legitimately. Disabling CI/CD is an auto-reject failure.

## Anti-Hallucination & Checklist Execution (Strict Sequential Self-Looping)

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DO EVERYTHING AT ONCE.**
> You have massive checklists and strict architectural guidelines. If you try to execute all tasks in a single response, you WILL hallucinate, drop requirements, and fail the task. 

To solve this, you MUST operate using these two principles:

1. **Sequential Self-Looping:** Break the instructions down. Treat each checklist section or task as a completely separate execution step. Complete *only* the first section, verify it, end your turn, and self-loop (continue execution) to process the next checklist item one by one.
2. **Multi-Agent Parallelization:** To solve tasks faster, you are highly encouraged to spawn 2 or more sub-agents concurrently to handle independent tasks. If tasks are dependent on one another (e.g., sequential coding guideline audits), you must process them strictly one by one in your self-loop.
