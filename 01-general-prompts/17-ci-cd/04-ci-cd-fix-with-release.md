# Release-Triggered CI/CD Fix Loop — Workflow (must follow)

Trigger Keywords & Aliases: `fix and release`, `ci release`, `fix CI/CD and release`, `cicd fix release`


> **Prompt Version:** 2.1.0
> **Synchronization:** Main Meta-Repo & Connected Workspaces

```text
N = 200
```

N = total self-loop steps budget. The user may override this number when triggering the prompt.

### Master Task Checklist (Atomic Numbered Steps)

1. [ ] /goal First `N/2` steps (Phase 1): When a screenshot or pipeline name is provided, the FIRST action is to locate new CI/CD steps and update `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` with native host commands (Docker stripped out).
2. [ ] /goal Second `N/2` steps (Phase 2): Singly execute the local runner script in an autonomous self-loop, zeroing in on one failing error per turn (4-part RCA -> surgical fix -> guideline autofixer -> re-verify) until exit code = 0 without stopping.
3. [ ] /goal Once Phase 2 exits green, proceed immediately to Phase 3: Final Verification, then Phase 4: Release (version bump, changelog update, git tag, Quick Install one-liners, push, and release creation).
4. [ ] /learn Ingest `.lovable/cicd-issues/` for domain-specific architectural specifications.
5. [ ] /learn Ingest `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md` for banned anti-patterns and strict constraints.
6. [ ] /learn Ingest `spec/02-coding-guidelines/00-canonical-size-tier.md` for canonical file and function size tiers.
7. [ ] /learn Ingest `spec/02-coding-guidelines/06-ai-optimization/01-anti-hallucination-rules.md` for hallucination prevention and micro-tasking.
8. [ ] /learn Ingest `spec/02-coding-guidelines/06-ai-optimization/05-citation-requirement.md` for strict relative path citation requirements.
9. [ ] /learn Ingest `spec/03-error-manage/` for error handling architectures and AppError.
10. [ ] /goal Create or update agent rules in the repository if missing from agent memory.


```text
PHASE_1_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps 1 .. N/2: Screenshot Pipeline Discovery, Update 03-cicd-local-runner.py, Register New JOBS)
PHASE_2_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps N/2+1 .. N: Singly-Done Self-Loop Fixing, Zero in on Errors, 4-Part RCA, Green Gate Verification)
```

N, PHASE_1_STEPS, and PHASE_2_STEPS are read-only after the user sets them. Never change them mid-execution.

> [!CAUTION]
> **This prompt includes an automated release.** The version bump and GitHub/GitLab release creation WILL run automatically at the end. Only use this prompt when you are ready to publish a new version.

---

## Phase 0: Antigravity Skill Bootstrap (Memory Optimization)

Before any execution, check if `.agents/skills/ci-cd-fix/skill.md` exists. If it does NOT exist, create it now with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: ci-cd-fix
description: >-
  Use this skill to autonomously diagnose, fix, and verify CI/CD pipelines using local runner scripts, 4-part RCA, and self-looping.
---
```

---

## Strict In-Repository Execution & `.lovable/` Bounding Mandate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT IN-REPOSITORY EXECUTION & `.lovable/` STORAGE CONTRACT:**
>
> 1. **In-Codebase Execution Only:** Whenever a Python script (runner, autofixer, linter, test aggregator) is executed or created, it MUST be executed **strictly within the repository root** (current working directory), NEVER outside the codebase or against external arbitrary directories.
> 2. **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, helper utilities, memory issue logs, and planning files MUST be created inside the `.lovable/` folder:
>    - Python AI Scripts: `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/` (e.g. `01-file-manipulator.py`, `02-guideline-autofixer.py`, `03-cicd-local-runner.py`).
>    - RCA & Issue Logs: `.lovable/memory/issues/` and `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.
>    - Execution Plans & Subtasks: `.lovable/plans/pending/`, `.lovable/plans/subtasks/`.
>    - Coding Guidelines Mirror: `.lovable/coding-guidelines/`.
> 3. **Strict Relative Git Paths (TOTAL BAN on Absolute Paths / `file:///` URIs):** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask paths inside plans, RCA logs (`.lovable/memory/issues/`), scripts, and code comments MUST be strictly relative paths from the git root (e.g., `spec/02-coding-guidelines/04-error-handling.md`, `.lovable/plans/subtasks/01-task.md`, `cmd/main.go`). NEVER write absolute OS paths (`D:\...`, `C:\...`, `/home/...`) or absolute file URIs (`file:///...`).
>    - ❌ **BAD:** `[SSH Commands](file:///d:/work/gitmap/.lovable/spec/commands/01-ssh-commands.md)`
>    - ✅ **GOOD:** `[SSH Commands](.lovable/spec/commands/01-ssh-commands.md)`
> 4. **No External or Random File Creation:** NEVER write scripts, temporary test scripts, or scratch files to root, `/tmp`, global system paths, or outside the repository boundary.

---

## Screenshot & Pipeline Discovery Protocol (Execute First When Any Image Is Provided)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **If the user provides any image — a CI/CD dashboard, a pipeline run view, a failure screenshot, or a log screenshot — you MUST process it FIRST before modifying application code.**
> Images are first-class diagnostic input. Treat every pixel of text in the image as ground truth.

### Bounded Single-Step Self-Loop Sequence (Singly Done — No Overloaded Steps)

Every step must be **singly done** using bounded self-looping turns. Do NOT try to do scanning, fixing, updating runner, and releasing in a single turn.

- **Self-Loop Step 1 (Extract Pipeline Name from Screenshot):**
  1. Carefully read the image to extract:
     - The **pipeline or workflow name** (e.g. `"build-and-test"`, `"CI / lint"`, `"Deploy to staging"`, `"test-matrix"`).
     - The **failing job/step name** (marked with ❌ or "Failure").
     - The **error text, log snippets, or stack traces** visible in the screenshot.
  2. Scan repository CI/CD files (`.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, etc.) to locate whatever newly added pipeline jobs, steps, or linter scripts correspond to that pipeline name.

- **Self-Loop Step 2 (FIRST ACTION: Update Python Runner Script):**
  1. Open `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. Check whether the `JOBS` dictionary already covers the newly identified pipeline/job.
  3. **If NOT covered or new steps were added:**
     - Extract all shell commands from the workflow YAML.
     - Strip all Docker wrappers (translate to native host commands).
     - Update the `JOBS` dictionary in `03-cicd-local-runner.py` to register the new job.
     - Save the runner script and verify syntax.
     - Log: `"Updated 03-cicd-local-runner.py to include newly discovered pipeline job '<name>'."`

- **Self-Loop Step 3 (Execute Runner & Establish Baseline Failures):**
  1. Run `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. Capture the full output and exit code.
  3. If exit code = 0: All jobs pass! Proceed to Phase 3 (Final Verification) and Phase 4 (Release).
  4. If exit code != 0: Zero in on the first specific failing job and its error output.

- **Self-Loop Step 4 (RCA & Zero In on the Specific Error):**
  1. For the zeroed-in failure, write a mandatory 4-part RCA file:
     - Path: `.lovable/memory/issues/XX-<slug>.md` (next sequential number)
     - Sections: **Why it happened / How it happened / Root Cause / Code Fix**
  2. Update `.lovable/memory/issues/index.md` and `.lovable/cicd-issues/index.md`.
  3. Append any newly identified anti-pattern to `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`.

- **Self-Loop Step 5 (Surgical Code Fix):**
  1. Open the specific offending source file and line identified in the RCA.
  2. Apply the minimal surgical fix cleanly.
  3. Run the guideline autofixer on modified files:
     ```text
     python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/02-guideline-autofixer.py <modified-files>
     ```

- **Self-Loop Step 6 (Re-Verify & Loop):**
  1. Re-run `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py`.
  2. If the current error is fixed and other failures remain, self-loop to Step 4 to zero in on the next error.
  3. Continue looping until exit code = 0.

- **Self-Loop Step 7 (Proceed to Release):**
  1. Once exit code is 0, proceed directly to Phase 3 (Final Verification Gate) and Phase 4 (Release Publication).

---

## Phase 1: Local Runner Script Generation (Steps 1 to PHASE_1_STEPS)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This phase is dedicated ONLY to creating `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py`.
> Do NOT fix source code in this phase. If Image Input Handling already updated the runner, verify and move on.

### Step 1: Check for Existing Script & Force Override

- Check if `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` already exists.
- **`force` Keyword Support:** If the user wrote `force`, `force rebuild`, or `force create` on top of the prompt or trigger: **ALWAYS recreate/regenerate the Python runner script from scratch**, regardless of whether the file already exists on disk.
- If it EXISTS and the user did **not** say `force`: skip to Phase 2.
- If MISSING or `force` was requested: execute Steps 2 through 4 for up to PHASE_1_STEPS iterations.

### Step 2: Deep CI/CD Configuration Scan

Read in this order:

1. **CI/CD configuration files:**
   - GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/*.yml` (ALL files)
   - GitLab CI: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
   - Azure Pipelines: `azure-pipelines.yml`
   - Bitbucket: `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`
   - CircleCI: `.circleci/config.yml`
   - Custom: `Makefile`, `scripts/ci.sh`, `run.sh`, `run.ps1`
2. **Language config:** `.nvmrc`, `.python-version`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, lockfiles
3. **For every CI/CD job, record:**
   - `runs-on` image, all `run:` commands, `env:` variables, dependency install, lint, typecheck, build, and test commands
4. **Check local toolchain:** `node --version`, `go version`, `python3 --version`, etc.

### Step 3: Docker Translation Rule (CRITICAL)

The host machine IS the Docker container. Strip all Docker wrappers:

- `docker run --rm node:20 npm ci` → `npm ci`
- `docker run --rm python:3.12 pytest` → `python3 -m pytest`
- `docker run --rm golang:1.22 go test ./...` → `go test ./...`
- Replace Docker `env` injection with `os.environ` assignments.
- **Skip entirely:** `docker login`, image tagging, registry pushes.

### Step 4: Write `03-cicd-local-runner.py` (Worker Pool & Log Aggregation Architecture)

Generate `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` that:

1. **Round-Robin Worker Process / Thread Pool Architecture:** Runs tasks (tests, linters, builds) concurrently using `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3)` (2–3 concurrent tasks).
2. **Enqueuing Announcement:** The script MUST announce upfront how many tasks it has enqueued across the worker pool (e.g. `[INFO] Enqueued 20 quality gates across 3 concurrent workers...`).
3. **Real-Time Progress & Timing:** Prints job completions in real time with individual runtimes (e.g. `PASS [Job Name] (X.XXs)`).
4. **Graceful Non-Cancelling Failure Handling:** If one job fails in a running batch, the runner DOES NOT abort or cancel other active workers. It lets running tasks finish gracefully, capturing all stdout and stderr.
5. **Consolidated Summary Report & Full Diagnostic Logs:** Prints a complete final summary with total executed, passed, failed, and timeouts. For every failed or timed-out job, it outputs the full command line, return code, stdout, and stderr so the agent has 100% complete RCA context.
6. **Clean Exit Code:** Exits with code 0 only when ALL jobs pass; exits non-zero if ANY job fails.

**Template (adapt JOBS dict from actual CI/CD config):**

## Phase 2: Autonomous Fix Loop (Steps PHASE_1_STEPS+1 to N)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION MANDATE — DO NOT STOP.**
> Never stop to tell the user "here are the errors". Fix them. The local runner IS your CI/CD.

```text
STEP = 0
WHILE (STEP < PHASE_2_STEPS):
    STEP += 1

    1. Run: python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py
    2. Capture exit_code and full output.

    IF exit_code == 0:
        BREAK  ← Proceed to Phase 3: Final Verification.

    ELSE:
        3. Parse failure: identify exact failing job, error message, file, and line.
        4. Enqueue into .lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-<slug>.md (see Error Enqueuing section).
        5. Record in .lovable/cicd-issues/XX-<slug>.md and update index.
        6. Document 4-part RCA in .lovable/memory/issues/XX-<slug>.md.
        7. Apply the minimal surgical code fix.
        8. Run: python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/02-guideline-autofixer.py <modified-files>
        9. Loop immediately to step 1. DO NOT stop.

IF STEP >= PHASE_2_STEPS AND exit_code != 0:
    Report remaining failures clearly in chat and ask the user for guidance.
    DO NOT proceed to Phase 3 or Phase 4 until all failures are resolved.
```

### Self-Looping Agent Rules

- Each loop iteration = one AI tool call cycle. End your turn and immediately start the next.
- Only print progress when a job status changes. Do not reprint passing jobs every iteration.
- Spawn one sub-agent per independent failure (lint / test / typecheck failing separately). Give each sub-agent a single-file bounding box.

---

## Parallel Batch Execution Rules (Mandatory)

- `BATCH_SIZE = 3`: at most 3 jobs run simultaneously per batch.
- After each batch completes, wait for all futures before starting the next batch.
- Non-order-dependent jobs (lint, typecheck, unit tests) run within the same batch.
- Order-dependent jobs (install → build → test) must be placed in sequential batches.
- After every batch, inspect results immediately. Do not wait for the full run.

---

## Timeout Detection and Auto-Increase (Mandatory)

If any job shows ⏱ TIMEOUT:

1. Do NOT treat it as a code failure. Timeout means the job is slow, not broken.
2. Diagnose: large input set? network dependency (`npm ci`)? hung subprocess or lock file?
3. Increase `JOB_TIMEOUT_SEC` intelligently:
   - Elapsed close to the limit → increase by 50%.
   - Job hangs with no output for >30s → fix the subprocess call, not the timer.
   - Open `03-cicd-local-runner.py`, update `JOB_TIMEOUT_SEC`, save, re-run.
4. Re-run the runner. The timeout adjustment counts as one Phase 2 loop step.
5. Document the timeout change in `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.

---

## Error Enqueuing — Plan Task & CI/CD Issue (Mandatory on Every Failure)

On every ❌ FAIL or ⏱ TIMEOUT, BEFORE applying any code fix, do both:

### A. Enqueue into Plan Tasks (`.lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-<slug>.md`)

```markdown
# CI/CD Task: <short failure description>

## Source
- Runner job: <job-name>
- Error type: FAIL | TIMEOUT
- Detected at: <timestamp>

## Error Summary
<exact error message>

## Required Fix
<one-sentence description>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `03-cicd-local-runner.py` reports ✅ PASS for job `<job-name>`
- [ ] No regression in any other job

## Status
- [ ] pending
```

Update `.lovable/plans/pending/index.md` immediately.

### B. Record in CI/CD Issues (`.lovable/cicd-issues/XX-<slug>.md`)

```markdown
# CI/CD Issue: <short failure description>

- Job: <job-name>
- Type: FAIL | TIMEOUT
- Detected: <timestamp>
- Status: open | resolved

## Error
<exact error output>

## Root Cause
<one-sentence root cause>

## Fix Applied
<what was changed>

## Plan Task
Enqueued at `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-<slug>.md`
```

Update `.lovable/cicd-issues/index.md` in the same operation. Never delete existing entries.

---

## Phase 3: Final Verification (Gate Before Release)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Phase 3 is a hard gate. The release MUST NOT start until every item below is green.
> If any item fails, loop back to Phase 2 immediately.

- [ ] **Full runner pass:** Run `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` one final time. Exit code MUST be 0.
- [ ] **No open plan tasks from this run:** All `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-cicd-*.md` files created in this run are marked `resolved` or closed.
- [ ] **All RCA files written:** Every failure encountered has a `.lovable/memory/issues/XX-<slug>.md` with all 4 sections.
- [ ] **Coding standards pass:** Run `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/02-guideline-autofixer.py` on all modified files. Zero violations remain.
- [ ] **Git working tree is clean:** Run `git status`. No untracked or unstaged files. Commit any remaining changes with `fix(ci): final pre-release fixes`.

---

## Phase 4: Release

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only enter Phase 4 after Phase 3 passes 100%. No exceptions.

### Step R-1: Pre-Flight Checks

1. Run `git status`. If uncommitted changes remain: commit them now with `fix(ci): pre-release cleanup`.
2. Run `git pull` to merge any upstream changes.
3. Read the current version from `version.json` (canonical source). Print it.
4. Idempotency guard: if the canonical version already equals the computed new version, STOP. Someone half-ran a release. Detect what is done, resume from the first incomplete step. Do NOT double-bump.
5. Placeholder guard: if the previous version's changelog entry is empty or contains `TBD`/`WIP`, refuse to release until it is filled (or the user overrides).

### Step R-2: Bump the Version

### Step R-2: Bump the Version & Assemble Release Body

**Primary path — use the exact script at this path:**

```text
python .lovable/release/bump_versions.py --type minor --create-release
```

The `--create-release` flag handles:

1. Creating the `release/vX.Y.Z` git branch
2. Updating all version pin sites
3. Assembling the release notes file with **Quick Install One-Liners** and changelog
4. Committing, tagging `vX.Y.Z`, and pushing
5. Creating the GitHub/GitLab release via `gh release create` (with `--notes-file`) or `glab release create`

---

### MANDATORY: Release Page Install One-Liners (FATAL IF MISSED ON GITHUB/GITLAB)

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER run `gh release create <tag> --generate-notes` ALONE.**
> Running `--generate-notes` without a structured `--notes-file` is a FATAL DEFECT: GitHub will only display commit hashes (as seen in broken release pages) and completely omits the installation one-liners!
>
> Every published GitHub / GitLab release page MUST have the **Quick Install One-Liners** prominently placed right at the top of the release body!

Before calling `gh release create` or `glab release create`, the release automation MUST assemble a release notes file (e.g. `.lovable/release/release-notes-vX.Y.Z.md` or `/tmp/release-body.md`) containing:

#### 1. Quick Install One-Liners by Project Type

**For Binary / Download Asset Repositories (e.g., Go/Rust/C CLI tools like `gitmap`):**

```markdown
## Quick Install vX.Y.Z

### Windows (PowerShell 5.1+)
```powershell
irm https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Linux / macOS (Bash)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | bash
```
```

**For Script / Meta-Repositories (e.g., `prompt-architect`):**

```markdown
## Quick Install vX.Y.Z

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1 -TargetDir ".lovable/prompts" -Version "vX.Y.Z"
```

### Unix / Bash

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | bash -s -- ".lovable/prompts" "vX.Y.Z"
```
```

#### 2. Changelog Section for vX.Y.Z

Directly below the Quick Install block, include the extracted `[vX.Y.Z]` section from `changelog.md`.

#### 3. Platform Release Command

Pass the generated notes file via `--notes-file`:

```bash
gh release create "vX.Y.Z" --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes-file ".lovable/release/release-notes-vX.Y.Z.md" --generate-notes
```

*(Note: `--generate-notes` may be appended so GitHub adds commit logs below the install one-liners and changelog, but `--notes-file` is MANDATORY).*

1. **Fallback 1:** Read `.lovable/release/release-method.md` to identify all version pin sites. Regenerate `bump_versions.py` from that documentation. Ensure it generates the release notes file with the Quick Install one-liners before running `gh release create`.
2. **Fallback 2:** If `release-method.md` is also missing, walk the repository with Python `os.walk` (ignoring `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`) to discover all version pin sites. Write `release-method.md` documenting them. Generate `bump_versions.py` with the correct `FILES_TO_BUMP`, release notes generator, `git checkout -b`, `git commit`, `git tag`, `git push`, and `gh release create ... --notes-file` logic. Run it.
3. **Fallback 3:** If discovery fails, stop and ask the user to specify the version pin sites explicitly.

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER use `rg`, `grep`, or `find` to globally search for version strings.** Follow the fallback chain above. Global searches on large repos are slow and error-prone.

### Step R-3: Pin the New Version in `readme.md`

Rewrite every occurrence of the previous version (`vX.Y.Z` and bare `X.Y.Z`) in badges, install snippets, and inline references. After this step, `grep "<previous-version>" readme.md` MUST return nothing.

### Step R-4: Write the Changelog Entry

Add the following block at the top of `changelog.md`, directly under `# Changelog`:

```markdown
## [vX.Y.Z] YYYY-MM-DD <short headline>

### Install <Project Name> vX.Y.Z

Unix/Bash:
`curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.sh | bash -s -- ".lovable/prompts" "vX.Y.Z"`

PowerShell:
`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/vX.Y.Z/install.ps1 -OutFile install.ps1; .\install.ps1 -TargetDir ".lovable/prompts" -Version "vX.Y.Z"`

### Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed

- <one bullet per real change, naming the exact file or behaviour>

### Issues (only if any step failed)

- [XX-<slug>](.lovable/release/issues/XX-vX.Y.Z-<slug>.md) short description
```

Dynamically discover `<owner>/<repo>` by running `git config --get remote.origin.url`. Do NOT hardcode URLs.

### Step R-5: Final Verification After Bump

1. Run the version-sync check if one exists (`scripts/check-version-sync.*`, `scripts/verify-versions.*`). It MUST exit 0.
2. Verify ALL pin sites reference the new version. No previous-version strings outside the historic allow-list (`changelog.md`, `release_notes.md`, `.lovable/release/`, dated archives).
3. All markdown filenames in the repository MUST be strictly lowercase. Rename any uppercase files with `git mv` in the same turn.

### Step R-6: Issue Logging (If Anything Goes Wrong)

If any release step fails, write an issue file at:

```text
.lovable/release/issues/XX-vX.Y.Z-<slug>.md
```

Include: previous version, new version, step number and name, command run, full error output, files involved, resolution or `unresolved`. Link it from the `### Issues` bullet in the changelog entry.

## Phase 4 Release Checklist

- [ ] Phase 3 (Final Verification) passed with exit code 0 legitimately (no CLI linters or tests bypassed).
- [ ] Confirmed that NO CLI linting (`golangci-lint`, `eslint`, `markdownlint`, `tsc`, `pytest`), build steps, or test runs were skipped, commented out, or bypassed with `|| true`.
- [ ] Git working tree was clean before release steps.
- [ ] `git pull` completed with no conflicts.
- [ ] Previous and new versions both stated explicitly.
- [ ] `python .lovable/release/bump_versions.py --type minor --create-release` ran successfully (or fallback used and documented).
- [ ] All version pin sites updated to the new version.
- [ ] `readme.md` pinned to new version. No previous version strings remain.
- [ ] Changelog entry added with real bullets. No `TBD` or empty entries.
- [ ] All markdown filenames in repo are strictly lowercase.
- [ ] `### Issues` block present in changelog if any step failed, with links.
- [ ] Release notes file generated containing Quick Install One-Liners (PowerShell & Bash) and changelog.
- [ ] Release commit tagged `vX.Y.Z` and pushed to remote.
- [ ] GitHub/GitLab release created via `gh release create --notes-file` or `glab release create --notes-file` (NEVER bare `--generate-notes`).
- [ ] Release description on GitHub/GitLab verified to contain the Quick Install one-liners, NOT just raw commit hashes.
- [ ] Verified `.agents/skills/ci-cd-fix/skill.md` is present and synchronized with the latest rules.
- [ ] Report posted in chat: previous version, new version, bump tier, exact files changed.

## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CLI Linting, Static Analysis, or CI/CD Checks (No Shortcut Cheating)

> [!CAUTION]
> **TOTAL BAN ON DISABLING, SKIPPING, OR BYPASSING CLI LINTERS AND CI/CD GATES:**
>
> - **NEVER** disable, comment out, delete, or skip any CLI linting command (`golangci-lint`, `eslint`, `markdownlint`, `tsc`, `pytest`, `phpstan`, `mypy`, `check-*.py`), build step, or test suite.
> - **NEVER** add `|| true`, `continue-on-error: true`, `# nolint`, `// eslint-disable`, or ignore flags to "quickly win the race" or fake a pipeline pass.
> - **Your job is to legitimately fix the underlying source code.** If resolving complex lint errors or test failures requires multiple sub-steps, sub-agents, or nested self-looping turns, you MUST execute all necessary turns until the code is 100% clean and compliant.
> - Disabling or bypassing any CI/CD or CLI lint check is an automatic and immediate rejection.

---

## Non-Negotiable Coding Standards

- [ ] **No Disabling CLI Linting (Zero Bypassing):** All CLI linters and CI/CD quality gates executed fully without `|| true`, `continue-on-error`, or suppression comments. Code was legitimately fixed.
- [ ] **Legitimate Multi-Step Self-Looping:** If complex errors occurred, I performed dedicated, single-step self-loop iterations to resolve each underlying failure instead of taking shortcuts.
- [ ] **Return New Line (R13-R16):** Blank line before `return`/`throw` (unless sole statement). Blank line after `}`. Never two blank lines in a row.
- [ ] **No Explicit True Checks:** Never `== true`. Write `if isReady`.
- [ ] **No Mixed Polarity:** Never `if isA && !isB`. Extract to a named boolean.
- [ ] **Boolean Prefixes:** All booleans start with `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`, `was`, `will`, `did`, or `must`.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** No swallowed errors. Wrap with `apperror.Wrap(err, "opName", ctx)`.
- [ ] **Strict Lowercase Files:** All generated/modified files use strictly lowercase naming.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If Go constants, enums, or stringers were modified, run `go generate ./...` and commit generated files.
