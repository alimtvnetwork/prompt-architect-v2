# Instruction (must follow): Autonomous QA & Unit Testing Loop (v4)

/goal Create a comprehensive execution plan to achieve 100% test coverage across the repository, split the work into logical subtasks, and autonomously spawn subagents in a continuous self-loop to execute the testing plan until complete. 

/learn Ingest `.lovable/memory/00-index.md`, `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`, and `spec/02-coding-guidelines/` before touching any code.

## MUST FOLLOW NON-NEGOTIABLE

Listen, past runs of these turns have been sloppy and stupid as fuck: wrong step counts, partial task lists dumped into chat instead of files, plans and session summaries half-filled with "[N]" placeholders, folders skimmed, open ambiguities ignored, CI/CD issues and `plans/subtasks/` forgotten, user commands dropped, coding guidelines bypassed, detailed specs chopped and summarized into useless junk, uppercase README files left uncorrected, `.lovable/memories/` created by accident, `strictly-avoid.md` overwritten, and explicit user instructions softened after being told not to. WTF. How on earth are you reverting to this carelessness, are you stupid?? Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the whole codebase, read every folder in `spec/` and `.lovable/`, confirm root `readme.md` is strictly lowercase, find the root cause in one sentence, capture commands, issues, and pending tasks without omitting a single item, write the spec files and memory files in the right paths, update every index in the same turn, sync `readme.md` with `what-to-read.md`, preserve detailed specs verbatim with zero truncation, run builds and full unit tests, group commits with clear messages, and push everything to git before ending. Going deep IS the job. If you are not going deep, you are not doing the job. Violating this is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0. Avoid stupidity and being careless, you stupid fuck. Where is your attention, are you stupid? Tell me. Your stupidity is going on top of my head. Where did you learn this stupidity? If I could find you, I could slap you.



## STRICT AVOIDANCE: Never Disable CI/CD

> [!CAUTION]
> **NEVER disable any CI/CD checks, GitHub Actions, or validation workflows.** 
> Strictly avoid commenting out, bypassing, or deleting CI/CD steps to force a pipeline to pass. Your job is to fix the underlying code so that the CI/CD pipeline passes legitimately. Disabling CI/CD is an auto-reject failure.

## Anti-Hallucination, Micro-Tasking, & Self-Looping

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL RULE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO READ, PLAN, AND EXECUTE EVERYTHING AT ONCE.**
> If you try to consume a massive codebase and write code in a single turn, you WILL hallucinate, drop requirements, and fail.

To survive massive checklists and complex codebases, you MUST operate using these three principles:

1. **Phase 1: Read & Understand (Isolated Loop):** Your very first action must be purely exploratory. Do NOT write code. Break down the task, read the specific files, trace the dependencies, and understand the architectural boundary. Once you understand the scope, end your turn and self-loop to begin execution.
2. **Phase 2: Bounded Micro-Tasking (Sequential Self-Looping):** Never attempt to execute the entire checklist in one response. Treat each checklist section or file as a strict, isolated boundary. Execute *only* the first small portion, verify it, end your turn, and self-loop to process the next portion. 
3. **Phase 3: Multi-Agent Parallelization:** If tasks are independent, you MUST spawn dedicated sub-agents to handle them concurrently. Give each sub-agent an extremely small, strictly defined bounding box (e.g., "Only edit File X"). Never give a sub-agent a generic or multi-file task.

## Variables - Auto-Discovered at Runtime

```text
N = 200 (Default loop limit. User can override.)
```

## Phase 1: Planning & Segmentation

1. Identify packages with incomplete test coverage.
2. Segment large packages (>1000 lines) into discrete tasks (e.g., 200 lines per task).
3. Create a master plan file in `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-qa-coverage.md`.
4. Create explicit subtasks for each package segment in `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX-qa-coverage/SS-<subslug>.md`.

## Phase 2: Autonomous Execution Loop

1. Spawn dedicated sub-agents to handle the subtasks (MAXIMUM 3 concurrent agents).
2. Context Diet: When spawning a subagent, DO NOT paste file contents, memory logs, or the entire plan into its prompt. Give it the absolute minimal instruction (e.g., "Read subtask file `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX-qa-coverage/01-task.md` and execute it"). The subagent MUST read the necessary files itself.
3. Subagents must follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert).
4. Subagents must verify tests locally before marking the task `[Done]`.
5. Loop continuously until every subtask in the master plan is marked `[Done]`.


## Pre-Completion Checklist (Must Follow Non-Negotiable)

- [ ] Anti-Garbage Naming (Non-Negotiable): I have strictly verified that absolutely NO generic garbage variable names (e.g., `comp_100.go`, `temp`, `data`, `obj`, `Input100`, `TestHandleComp100`) were written. All names are highly semantic and domain-specific.
- [ ] All tests follow the AAA pattern.
- [ ] All tests run and pass locally.

## Anti-Garbage Naming & Quality (Zero Tolerance)

- NEVER generate arbitrary, generic, or sequential names like `TestComp100`. Test functions must explicitly define exactly what behavior is being tested (e.g., `TestUpdateUserProfile_RejectsInvalidEmail`).
- Do not hallucinate mock interfaces or use arbitrary IDs. Use semantic domain concepts.

## Ambiguity State Management

- If an ambiguity prevents a test from being written, log it to `.lovable/ambiguous-questions/`.
- Immediately update the plan file to mark that specific subtask as `[Blocked]`.
- The execution loop must safely skip `[Blocked]` tasks and continue executing other disjoint tasks. Do not retry blocked tasks.

## Temp Script Sandboxing (Global Law)

## AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** I have rigorously scanned and `/learn`ed `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` to check if a helper script already exists before writing any new temporary code.
- [ ] **Native File Manipulator:** If you need to perform mass file renaming, `.md` lowercase enforcement, sequence number re-ordering, or encoding fixes (CRLF/BOM), you MUST natively use `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/01-file-manipulator.py <command>` rather than writing a new script from scratch.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If you modify Go constants, enums, or stringers, you MUST run `go generate ./...` in the relevant directory (e.g., `cd gitmap && go generate ./...`) and commit the resulting generated files to prevent CI drift.
- [ ] **Commit & Track:** All new helper scripts were written strictly to `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/` and committed to Git for future reuse.
- [ ] **Index Documentation:** I have updated `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` using sequential script naming (e.g., `01-parse-files.py`). For every script, I have included a `<details>` collapsible tag explaining exactly why the script is there and what it does.

### Temp-Agent State Management Protocol (Non-Negotiable)

To ensure agents do not lose context, you MUST use the `.lovable/temp-agents/` directory for tracking sub-agent tasks.

- On Start: The sub-agent creates `.lovable/temp-agents/<task-name>.md` and writes the objective and `STATUS: IN_PROGRESS`.
- On Error/Crash: If an agent breaks or fails, append the exact error and cause to the file, then append `STATUS: FAILED` before closing.
- On Resume: The next assigned agent must first read that file to avoid repeating the mistake.
- On Success: Update the file to `STATUS: DONE` and immediately update the master plan.
