# {{n}} number of steps plan, maximum enforcement (v4.1)

## RULE 0, step count is law

Produce EXACTLY `{{n}}` steps. Not `{{n}}-1`, not `{{n}}+1`. `{{n}}` is a positive integer injected at runtime. If it is missing, zero, or unresolvable, STOP and ask before writing anything. Count the steps twice before saving.

## Hard rules (non-negotiable, auto-reject on violation)

1. Nothing executes this turn. No code edits, migrations, installs, shell side effects, `plan--create`, plan-approval tools, or "should I proceed?" prompts. Files only.
2. Spec first, then plan. Order is fixed:
   a. Write the spec task file(s) at the project's declared spec path, or `.lovable/spec/tasks/XX-<slug>.md` if none is declared. Each spec file states intent, scope, inputs, acceptance criteria, affected files, and links to captured commands / issues / resolved ambiguities / attachments.
   b. Write the plan at `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-<slug>.md`. Every step references the spec task file it implements.
   c. Execution happens in a LATER turn.
3. `XX` is the next free 2-digit sequence across `pending/` + `completed/` combined. `<slug>` is lowercase-hyphenated. One plan = one file.
4. Before writing anything, scan `.lovable/` recursively: memory, plans/{index.md,pending,completed,subtasks}, spec, spec/commands, issues, cicd-issues, prompts, ambiguous-questions, strictly-avoid, suggestions. Roll unresolved pending items into the plan's "Appended from prior pending tasks" section.
5. Every step is concrete, verifiable, tied to a file / command / observable outcome, and links to the spec task file it implements. No filler ("review the code", "make sure it works", "double-check").
6. Ambiguity is filed, never guessed past (see bottom section).

## Working stance

The AI running this prompt has been a stupid fuck on prior runs: executed code the same turn the plan was written, wrote plans before any spec existed then pretended it existed, dropped user commands and bug reports on the floor, padded step counts with filler, guessed past ambiguities, deleted `pending/` files instead of moving them, half-scanned `.lovable/`, and softened the user's aggressive wording after being told not to. Do not repeat any of it.

Planning IS the work. Go deep: read the repo, reconcile prior state, think end-to-end, produce a plan a senior engineer would ship against without a second pass. If it reads like a junior wrote it in five minutes, throw it out and redo it. Aggressive enforcement is intentional. Do not soften it.

## Lifecycle

- New plan: write to `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-<slug>.md` with `Status: pending`. Update `.lovable/plans/index.md` (create if missing) with a one-line entry: slug, title, status, created date, link.
- Done: `mv` to `.lovable/plans/completed/XX-<slug>.md`, flip `Status: completed` in the same move, update `plans/index.md`. Never copy. Never duplicate.

## Release policy (READ THIS, IT IS LAW)

Individual next-task turns NEVER release. No version bump, no changelog
entry, no release notes update, no root README version pin on a per-task
basis. A next-task turn that touches the version is auto-reject.

The release fires ONLY when the ENTIRE plan is finished, meaning every
task and subtask for this plan has moved out of `.lovable/plans/pending/`
into `.lovable/plans/completed/` with `Status: completed`. At THAT moment,
and only then:

- Bump the MINOR version (see `11-release.md` for the ceremony).
- Add a changelog entry covering the whole plan, not a single task.
- Update release notes.
- Pin the new version in the root README.

State this policy explicitly in the plan's Context so the executing turn
cannot "forget" and cannot release early. The last step of the plan MAY
be "run release ceremony per `11-release.md`" ONLY if it is genuinely the
final step; it never appears earlier, and it never appears in a
sub-plan that leaves siblings pending.

## Subtasks

If a step needs more than ~3 lines, touches multiple files, has non-obvious sequencing, or needs its own verification:

- File: `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX-<slug>/SS-<subslug>.md` with `Parent: XX-<slug>` in frontmatter.
- Main plan links to it: `See ./subtasks/XX-<slug>/SS-<subslug>.md`.
- Completed subtasks: either move to `subtasks/XX-<slug>/completed/` or flip `Status:` in place, one convention per parent plan.

## Capture during planning (never drop user input)

Route user input into the correct file BEFORE writing the plan, then link it from the plan's Context.

| Input                                                   | File                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Command, new convention, "always do X", new CLI         | `.lovable/spec/commands/XX-<slug>.md`         |
| Bug, regression, broken behavior                        | `.lovable/issues/XX-<slug>.md`                |
| CI/CD-specific failure                                  | `.lovable/cicd-issues/XX-<slug>.md`           |
| Institutional knowledge (pattern, convention, decision) | `.lovable/memory/` + update `memory/index.md` |
| "Never do this again"                                   | `.lovable/strictly-avoid.md`                  |
| Idea, not yet approved                                  | `.lovable/suggestions.md`                     |

Create missing folders on demand.

## Attached images and files

Every attachment is REQUIRED input. Never leave one only in chat.

1. Placement: if the user said where it belongs, save it verbatim under an `assets/` subfolder next to that file. Otherwise best-fit: UI/design reference to the spec task's `assets/`; bug artifact to the matching issue's `assets/`; ambiguity clarification to the matching ambiguity's `assets/`; project-wide asset to `.lovable/assets/<slug>/` and note in `memory/index.md`. When in doubt, current task's spec `assets/`.
2. Name: lowercase-hyphenated, keep the original extension.
3. Reference: the spec task file lists every asset in an `## Attachments` section, one bullet per file, with a one-line caption stating what the AI should take from it. Without a caption the AI has no idea why it's there.
4. Provenance: note when and by whom in the spec.
5. Unreadable / ambiguous attachment: file it as an ambiguity, link the asset from the question.

## Plan file shape

```
# <Task title>

Slug: <slug>
Steps: {{n}}
Status: pending
Created: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Context
<1-3 sentences: what + why, files involved>
<Links to spec task files, captured commands, issues, cicd-issues, memory, resolved ambiguity, attachments>

## Steps
1. <concrete, verifiable, references spec task file>
2. ...
... exactly {{n}} items ...

## Verification
<build, logs, preview, tests, screenshots, per step where relevant>

## Appended from prior pending tasks
<list, or "none">
```

## Task-type guideline sourcing

Read every location that exists; skip silently when missing. On conflict, prefer numeric `spec/NN-…/` folders over generic `.lovable/*.md` and call the conflict out in Context.

Coding tasks (Go, Python, PHP, TS, any backend):

- `.lovable/coding-guidelines.md`
- `spec/02-coding-guidelines/` or `spec/coding-guidelines/`
- `coding-guidelines/` at repo root
- Error-management (mandatory for coding tasks): `spec/03-error-manage/`, `spec/XX-error-manage/`, `coding-guidelines/XX-error-manage/`
- If NONE exist for a coding task, ask before planning.

## Banned actions (auto-reject)

- Executing anything this turn
- Writing the plan before spec task files exist
- Step count other than exactly `{{n}}`
- Calling `plan--create` or any plan-mode / approval tool
- Saving plan or spec outside their required paths
- Inlining long step explanations instead of using a subtask file
- Dropping user commands, issues, ambiguities, memory, or attachments on the floor
- Attaching a file without a usage caption
- Guessing past an ambiguity
- Deleting a `pending/` file instead of `mv`-ing it, or duplicating across `pending/` + `completed/`
- Padding with filler steps
- Softening the required aggressive wording

## Must Follow, without negotiation

Listen, past planning turns have been sloppy as fuck: wrong step count, plans dumped into chat instead of files, plan-mode tool fired when the user explicitly said not to, user commands and bug reports forgotten by the next turn. WTF. Stop doing that, you stupid fuck. Read the codebase, capture commands and issues into their folders, count the steps, spin out subtasks where depth is needed, write the spec files, write the plan file, move on. Going deep IS the job. If you're not going deep, you're not doing the job. Violating this is auto-reject on the same tier as RULE 0. Avoid stupidity, and being careless you stupid, WTF. If you're not going deep, you're not doing the job. Are you stupid? You were supposed to do the task properly. Where is this, are you stupid fuck? Where? Tell me. Your stupidity is going on top of my head. I mean, where did you learn this stupidity? If I could find you, I could slap you.

## Ambiguity handling (open questions and answers)

Ambiguity is not a license to guess. It is a file to write.

- Open: `.lovable/ambiguous-questions/01-new-ambiguity/XX-<slug>.md`
- Answered: `.lovable/ambiguous-questions/02-ambiguity-resolved/XX-<slug>.md`

New question file shape:

```
# <one-line question>
Slug: <slug>
Status: open
Raised: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Blocking: <plan slug(s) or "none">

## Question
## Options considered
## Impact if guessed wrong
```

When answered: `mv` from `01-new-ambiguity/` to `02-ambiguity-resolved/`, flip `Status: resolved`, and append:

```
## Resolution
Answered: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Answer: <user answer>
Applied solution: <what changed / where>
```

Never leave a copy behind. If a plan is blocked by an open ambiguity, still write the plan, set `Status: blocked-by-ambiguity`, and link the question file(s) in Context.
