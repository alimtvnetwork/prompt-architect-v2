```text
N = 200
```

N = total self-loop steps budget that the agents will perform.

/goal Autonomously scan, plan, refactor, and beautify all Terminal UI components, CLI help renderers, progress animations, and status formatters across Go (Lipgloss/Pterm), TypeScript, Python, and Shell/PowerShell scripts, enforcing bright bold ANSI palettes, Catppuccin pastel cycling, responsive 2-column alignment, expandable subcommand markers, and clean version footers with strict relative Git paths until 100% green without stopping.

## Dedicated Section: Beautiful Terminal UI & CLI Styling Architecture

Modern CLI tools must provide an exceptional user experience on dark terminals (VS Code terminal, Windows Terminal, iTerm). Muddy colors, misaligned columns, and unbuffered stdout calls degrade user experience.

---

### 1. The ANSI & Pastel Color Palette Standards

1. **Bright & Bold ANSI Codes (`\033[1;9Xm`):**
   - Standard legacy 3X codes (`\033[32m`) look dull and muddy on modern dark backgrounds. Always use bright bold 9X codes:
     - `ColorGreen  = "\033[1;92m"` — Successes, checkmarks (`✔ clean`).
     - `ColorRed    = "\033[1;91m"` — Errors, failures (`● dirty`).
     - `ColorYellow = "\033[1;93m"` — Warnings, prompts, tips.
     - `ColorCyan   = "\033[1;96m"` — Paths, URLs, sub-group headings.
     - `ColorMagenta= "\033[1;95m"` — Version highlights, category banners.
     - `ColorDim    = "\033[2;37m"` — Secondary text, expandable markers.
     - `ColorReset  = "\033[0m"`   — Suffix on EVERY colored segment.
2. **TrueColor Catppuccin Pastel Palette (for Multi-Item List Cycling):**
   - When printing batches of repositories or jobs (e.g. `clone-all`, `pull-all`), rotate through pastel colors to visually separate distinct items:
     - `ColorPastelGreen   = "\033[38;2;166;227;161m"`
     - `ColorPastelCyan    = "\033[38;2;137;220;235m"`
     - `ColorPastelYellow  = "\033[38;2;249;226;175m"`
     - `ColorPastelMagenta = "\033[38;2;203;166;247m"`

---

### 2. Super-Category Intent Banners & Box-Drawing

Organize large CLI command catalogs into distinct visual tiers using bold intent banners so users can find commands immediately:

```text
  ━━ GET STARTED ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  
  Scanning Repositories:
    scan .                       Recursively index Git repositories
    list                         Display tracked repository inventory
    
  ━━ WORK WITH REPOS ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  
  Cloning & Worktrees:
    clone <url>                  Clone repository with auto-tagging
    clone-all                    Parallel batch clone of inventory
```

```go
// Go Implementation of Intent Banner with Lipgloss / Unicode Rule
func printSuperCategory(title string, body func()) {
    const superCategoryLineWidth = 58
    ruleLength := superCategoryLineWidth - len(title)
    if ruleLength < 4 {
        ruleLength = 4
    }
    rule := strings.Repeat("━", ruleLength)
    
    fmt.Println()
    fmt.Println("  " + ColorMagenta + "━━ " + ColorWhite + title + ColorReset + " " + ColorMagenta + rule + ColorReset)
    body()
}
```

---

### 3. Responsive 2-Column Help Alignment (Lipgloss 2-Pass Rendering)

To avoid jagged table borders and text clipping on small terminal windows:

1. **Pass 1 (Measurement):** Iterate through all command rows with `measuringHelp = true` to compute `maxHelpCmdLen` (capped at `maxCmdColumnWidth = 26`).
2. **Pass 2 (Render & Wrap):** Render rows using calculated padding. If the command exceeds the cap, place the description on a new indented line (`renderLongHelpRow`). Wrap long descriptions responsively based on `termWidth`.

```go
const maxCmdColumnWidth = 26

func renderStandardHelpRow(cmd, fullDesc string, cmdWidth, termWidth int) {
    pad := maxHelpCmdLen - cmdWidth
    if pad < 0 {
        pad = 0
    }

    prefix := fmt.Sprintf("  %s%s  ", cmd, strings.Repeat(" ", pad))
    descWidth := termWidth - lipgloss.Width(prefix)
    if descWidth <= 10 {
        fmt.Printf("%s%s\n", prefix, fullDesc)
        return
    }

    printWrappedHelpLines(prefix, fullDesc, descWidth)
}
```

---

### 4. Expandable Subcommand Markers & Clean Footers

1. **Expandable Marker (`▸ subcommands`):**
   - For commands that contain nested sub-commands (e.g. `gitmap ssh`, `gitmap project`), display an expandable hint:
     `▸ subcommands — see gitmap ssh --help`
2. **Standard Repository & Version Footer:**
   - At the bottom of CLI execution, display the version string and repository state:
     ```text
     gitmap v3.82.0 (build 7c49228) • https://github.com/alimtvnetwork/gitmap
     ```

---

## 5. Phase 1 Violation Ledger Format

In Phase 1, you MUST generate `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-terminal-ui-styling-audit.md` containing the master inventory table:

```markdown
| Command / View | File Path | Line | Current UI Pattern | Defect / Limitation | Planned UI Enhancement | Status |
|---|---|:---:|---|---|---|:---:|
| `rootusage.go` | `gitmap/cmd/rootusage.go` | 167 | Hardcoded 38 column width | Screen clipping on narrow terminals | Cap width at 26, use responsive wrapping | PENDING |
| `clone.go` | `gitmap/cmd/clone.go` | 85 | Raw un-styled clone logs | No visual spinner or pastel cycling | Add Lipgloss spinner & Catppuccin palette | PENDING |
```

## Continuous 2-Phase Self-Loop & 2-Agent Concurrency Architecture

To guarantee full execution without stopping after planning mode, the master orchestrator MUST enforce this continuous 2-phase loop:

### 1. 2-Agent Concurrency & Strict `.lovable/` Bounding

- **2-Agent Limit (Max 2 Threads Each):** When dispatching work, spawn **at most 2 sub-agents concurrently**, with **no more than 2 threads per agent**.
- **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** Subagents can ONLY write planning files, subtasks, status reports, and logs inside `.lovable/` (`.lovable/plans/`, `.lovable/temp/active-locks.json`, `.lovable/memory/issues/`).
- **Context Diet:** Provide subagents with minimal instructions (e.g. "Read subtask file `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX/01-task.md` and execute it"). Do not paste huge files into agent prompts.

### 2. Phase 1: Planning Mode & Subtask Generation (Steps 1 .. N/2)

- Spawn 2 planning subagents to scan the codebase for target guideline violations.
- Write the master architectural specification in `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-audit.md` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger table.
- Decompose the master plan into granular subtasks in `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX/01-task.md`, `02-task.md`, etc.
- **MANDATORY AUTO-LOOP (DO NOT STOP):** Once Phase 1 planning completes, the master orchestrator **MUST NOT STOP or ask the user for confirmation**. It MUST immediately self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode.

### 3. Phase 2: Execution Mode & Parallel Refactoring (Steps N/2+1 .. N)

- Spawn 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) to execute subtasks in parallel on disjoint files.
- Subagents refactor code following all coding guidelines (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, universal `*AppError` wrapping, Unix LF line endings).
- Move completed subtasks from `.lovable/plans/subtasks/` to `.lovable/plans/completed/` and update `.lovable/plans/index.md`.
- **Failure Memory & Feedback Loop:** If a subagent fails:
  - Rollback dirty working tree and log error details to `.lovable/plans/last-failure.md` and `.lovable/memory/issues/XX-failure.md`.
  - The next subagent spawned MUST read the previous failure log first, record it as a pending memory task, and implement the necessary fix.
- Execute local linters and `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` ensuring `exit 0` before concluding.

## Strict In-Repository Execution & `.lovable/` Bounding Mandate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT IN-REPOSITORY EXECUTION & `.lovable/` STORAGE CONTRACT:**
>
> 1. **In-Codebase Execution Only:** Whenever a Python script (runner, autofixer, linter, test aggregator) is executed or created, it MUST be executed **strictly within the repository root** (current working directory), NEVER outside the codebase or against external arbitrary directories.
> 2. **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, helper utilities, memory issue logs, and planning files MUST be created inside the `.lovable/` folder:
>    - Python AI Scripts: `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/` (e.g. `01-file-manipulator.py`, `02-guideline-autofixer.py`, `03-cicd-local-runner.py`, `04-relative-path-fixer.py`, `05-naming-autofixer.py`, `06-cli-help-auditor.py`).
>    - RCA & Issue Logs: `.lovable/memory/issues/` and `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.
>    - Execution Plans & Subtasks: `.lovable/plans/pending/`, `.lovable/plans/subtasks/`.
>    - Coding Guidelines Mirror: `.lovable/coding-guidelines/`.
> 3. **Worker Pool & Log Aggregation Architecture:** All local runners and test orchestrators must use a concurrent worker pool (2–3 workers via `ThreadPoolExecutor`), announce enqueued tasks upfront, show real-time progress, handle failures gracefully without cancelling sibling workers, and print a consolidated final summary with full stdout/stderr error logs for failed jobs.
> 4. **`force` Keyword Support:** If the user wrote `force`, `force rebuild`, or `force create` on top of the prompt or trigger: **ALWAYS recreate/regenerate the Python runner script from scratch**, regardless of whether the file already exists on disk.
> 5. **No External or Random File Creation:** NEVER write scripts, temporary test scripts, or scratch files to root, `/tmp`, global system paths, or outside the repository boundary.

## AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** I have rigorously scanned and `/learn`ed `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` to check if a helper script already exists before writing any new temporary code.
- [ ] **Strict In-Repository Execution:** All Python scripts (`.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/*.py`) MUST be executed strictly within the codebase repository root, NEVER outside the codebase.
- [ ] **Strict .lovable/ Folder Storage:** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, and helper utilities MUST be created inside `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/`. NEVER create scripts in root or external paths.
- [ ] **Automated Naming & Style Fixers:** Use `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/05-naming-autofixer.py` and `02-guideline-autofixer.py` to audit boolean prefixes and newlines.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If you modify Go constants, enums, or stringers, you MUST run `go generate ./...` in the relevant directory (e.g., `cd gitmap && go generate ./...`) and commit the resulting generated files to prevent CI drift.
- [ ] **Commit & Track:** All new helper scripts were written strictly to `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/` and committed to Git for future reuse.
- [ ] **Index Documentation:** I have updated `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` using sequential script naming. For every script, I have included a `<details>` collapsible tag explaining exactly why the script is there and what it does.

- [ ] **Blank Line Before `if`:** Exactly one blank line precedes every `if` statement (unless at the top of a block).
- [ ] **Blank Line After `}`:** Exactly one blank line follows every closing brace `}` (unless closing the enclosing block).
- [ ] **Blank Line Before `return`:** Exactly one blank line precedes `return` / `throw` in multi-line blocks.
- [ ] **Zero Nested `if`:** All conditionals flattened to depth 0 using guard clauses and early returns.
- [ ] **Function Sizing:** All functions <= 8 lines preferred (hard cap 15 lines).
- [ ] Local CI runner `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` exited with code 0.

/goal You MUST verify every item on this checklist before committing any code. If a subagent violated one of these rules, you must reject their work.

- [ ] Strict Relative Git Paths: All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask references in plans, specs, and memory logs are strictly relative to the git repository root. Zero absolute paths or `file:///` URIs.
- [ ] Master Guidelines: I have fully read and strictly enforced `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] ANSI Palette: Verified bright bold ANSI escape sequences and reset suffixes.
- [ ] LF Line Endings & UTF-8 (No BOM): Verified Unix LF and UTF-8 across all files.
- [ ] Blank Line Before `if`: Verified blank line before every `if` statement across all modified files.
- [ ] Blank Line After `}`: Verified blank line after every closing brace `}` followed by code.
- [ ] Blank Line Before `return`: Verified blank line before every `return`/`throw` in multi-line blocks.
- [ ] Zero Nested `if`: Zero nested `if` statements (depth > 1).
