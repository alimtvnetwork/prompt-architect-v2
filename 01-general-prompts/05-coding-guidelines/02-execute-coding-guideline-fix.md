# Instruction (must follow): Execute Coding Guideline Fixes

/goal Apply concrete, surgical fixes for all coding guideline violations listed in the pending tasks. Strictly adhere to all style rules, boolean principles, function size limits (< 8 lines), and type-safety standards without introducing regressions.

/learn Ingest and internalize all coding standards, boolean extraction patterns, and error management rules before applying fixes.

Context & References:
- /learn master cross-language coding guidelines: `spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/15-master-coding-guidelines/`
- /learn braces, nesting, and conditions: `spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/04-code-style/01-braces-and-nesting.md` & `02-conditions-and-extraction.md`
- /learn function size caps (< 8 lines): `spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/04-code-style/04-function-and-type-size.md`
- /learn boolean naming & inverse rules: `spec/02-coding-guidelines/01-cross-language/02-boolean-principles/01-naming-prefixes.md` & `12-no-negatives.md`
- /learn error management & logging: `spec/03-error-manage/00-overview.md`
- /learn language-specific rules in `spec/02-coding-guidelines/` (Go wrapped booleans: `spec/02-coding-guidelines/03-golang/09-wrapped-boolean-results.md`)

/goal - Apply concrete fixes for all violations listed in the pending tasks.
- Enforce non‑negotiable rules:
  - DRY – eliminate duplicated logic.
  - Use typed enums instead of magic strings or numbers.
  - Functions must be strictly < 8 lines. (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
  - Source files must be ≤ 80 lines.
  - No code mutation – only apply fixes, never introduce new bugs.
  - Positive boolean naming (`is` / `has`). No `isNot`. Use inverse naming (e.g., `isHonest` / `isDishonest` instead of `isNotHonest`). No nested `if`s, no magic values.
  - Style: Ensure a blank line before every `return` statement.
  - Golang Single Return & Wrapped Booleans: Strictly return a single parameter (bundle multiple returns into a struct). No raw booleans returned in Go. Return a single Result struct (bundling Data, AppError, and Status together) with two flags (`IsSuccess` and `IsFailed`) managed by a constructor (`NewSuccess`/`NewFailure`).
  - Example usage (Note the explicit variable name `paymentStatus`, no short names like `res`):
    ```go
    paymentStatus := ProcessPayment(100)
    if paymentStatus.IsFailed {
        // handle error
    } else if paymentStatus.IsSuccess {
        // handle success
    }
    ```

### Checklist (execute phase)

1. Read pending tasks from the `.lovable/plans/subtasks/01-coding-guideline-fixes/` folder.
2. For each task:
   - Locate the affected source file.
   - Verify the file size ≤ 80 lines; if > 80, split into logical modules.
   - Refactor duplicated code into a shared helper function.
   - Replace magic strings/numbers with a newly defined enum in a dedicated `enums.dart` (or appropriate language file).
   - Ensure the refactored function body is ≤ 8 lines; extract sub‑logic to private helpers if needed.
   - Run the project's test suite and the Go race detector (`go test -race ./...`).
   - If tests pass, stage the changes.
3. Commit each fix using the CI/CD fix workflow:
   - Run `git add <modified files>`.
   - Commit with message `fix(coding-guidelines): resolve <issue‑id>`.
   - If any file changed, bump a minor version tag (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "minor release"`).
   - Push commits and tags (`git push origin main && git push origin --tags`).
4. Update the pending task file to mark it as completed.
5. If no pending tasks remain, output a summary of all fixes applied.

### Non‑Hallucination Policy

- Do not assume the existence of a file or enum that is not present; if uncertain, raise a question to the user.
- If a fix would require a large architectural change beyond the scope, create a new pending task instead of applying it directly.

### Execution Loop

- Process up to 50 tasks per run to avoid long‑running blocks.
- After each batch, report progress and await user confirmation before proceeding to the next batch.
