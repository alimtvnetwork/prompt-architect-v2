```text
N = 200
```

N = total self-loop steps budget that the agents will perform.

/goal Autonomously scan, plan, refactor, and fix all code hygiene, file size, parameter bloat, LF line ending (`\n`), UTF-8 (no BOM) encoding, and trailing newline violations across the codebase, enforcing 100-line standard file caps (recommended <= 80 lines), 8–15 line function caps, specialized parameter-reducing helper functions, extracting inline types, and sanitizing build artifacts until 100% green without stopping.

### Master Task Checklist (Atomic Numbered Steps)

1. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step A): Deeply scan the target codebase to inventory all architectural violations and anti-patterns.
2. [ ] /goal Phase 1 (Step B): Write the master audit specification in `.lovable/plans/pending/` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger.

```text
PHASE_1_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps 1 .. N/2: Scan Codebase, Write .lovable/plans/pending/ Spec, Create .lovable/plans/subtasks/, Verify/Create Linter Hook)
PHASE_2_STEPS = N / 2   (Steps N/2+1 .. N: Actively Edit Code, Normalize LF & UTF-8, Remove Double Blank Lines, File & Function Splits, Local CI Runner Verification)
```

N, PHASE_1_STEPS, and PHASE_2_STEPS are read-only after initialization. Never modify them mid-execution.

## Dedicated Section: Universal File Hygiene, Line Endings & Encoding Standards (Non-Negotiable)

Every repository artifact, source file (`.go`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.py`, `.php`, `.cs`, `.js`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`), and Markdown specification (`.md`) MUST strictly adhere to these universal file hygiene standards:

### 1. Unix LF (`\n`) Line Endings Only (TOTAL BAN on CRLF `\r\n`)

- **Strict LF:** Every file MUST use Unix-style line feeds (`\n`, `0x0A`).
- **Zero CRLF:** Windows-style carriage returns (`\r\n`, `0x0D 0x0A`) are strictly prohibited.
- Git and linters must verify LF across all files.

### 2. Strict UTF-8 Encoding (NO BOM)

- **UTF-8 Only:** All source code and markdown files MUST be encoded in **UTF-8 without Byte Order Mark (BOM)**.
- **BOM Banned:** Zero `\xef\xbb\xbf` header bytes. UTF-16 and UTF-32 are strictly forbidden.

### 3. Mandatory Single Trailing Newline at End of File (EOF)

- Every file MUST terminate with **exactly one newline (`\n`)** on the final line.
- Zero files missing a newline at EOF (`\ No newline at end of file` in Git diffs is an auto-reject).
- Zero multiple trailing blank lines at the end of a file (normalize to exactly one terminating newline).

### 4. No Function Starts with a Blank Line

- Every function body MUST begin writing executable code immediately on line 1 after the opening brace `{` (or `:` in Python).
- Placing an empty line as the first line of a function is strictly forbidden.

```go
// ❌ WRONG: Empty line right after opening brace
func CalculateDiscount(price float64) float64 {

    rate := getDiscountRate()
    return price * rate
}

// ✅ CORRECT: Code starts immediately on line 1; blank line before return
func CalculateDiscount(price float64) float64 {
    rate := getDiscountRate()

    return price * rate
}
```

### 5. Zero Double Blank Lines (`\n\n\n` Banned) in Code & Markdown

- There should **NEVER be two or more consecutive blank lines** anywhere inside source files or markdown documents.
- Always normalize multiple consecutive blank lines to exactly **one single blank line** (`\n\n`).

### 6. Markdown Header Spacing Rules (H1–H6: `#` through `######`)

- **Before Header:** Exactly **ONE blank line BEFORE** every markdown heading (EXCEPT when the heading is on line 1 of the file — line 1 has NO blank line before it).
- **After Header:** Exactly **ONE blank line AFTER** every markdown heading.

---

## Dedicated Section: Parameter Reduction & Specialized Helper Function Paradigm

Passing repeated constant arguments or flags across multiple call sites is a major source of code smell, parameter bloat, and boilerplate.

### Why Parameter Bloat & Repetition Is Forbidden

1. **Violates the <= 3 Parameters Limit:** Functions with excessive arguments are difficult to read, test, and maintain.
2. **Duplication of Context:** Hardcoding the same enum, flag, or code at 10 different call sites creates maintenance hazards when behavior changes.
3. **Impaired Readability:** Callers should express intent directly through semantic function names rather than passing tuples of flags and constants.

### The Specialized Helper Paradigm (Generic Example with Proper Newlines)

When a function call frequently repeats identical constants, enums, or exit codes, extract a specialized single-argument or zero-argument helper:

```go
// ❌ FORBIDDEN: Passing repeated constant/enum arguments at every call site
func ProcessPayload(data []byte) {
    if len(data) == 0 {
        reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeValidationFailure, SeverityLevelError)
        return
    }

    reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeProcessingSuccess, SeverityLevelInfo)
}

// ✅ REQUIRED: Specialized helper functions reducing parameter count and boilerplate
func ReportValidationError(data []byte) {
    reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeValidationFailure, SeverityLevelError)
}

func ReportSuccess(data []byte) {
    reporter.ReportEvent(data, EventTypeProcessingSuccess, SeverityLevelInfo)
}

func ProcessPayload(data []byte) {
    if len(data) == 0 {
        ReportValidationError(data)
        return
    }

    ReportSuccess(data)
}
```

## Canonical Size Tier Reference

You MUST adhere to the single source of truth defined in `spec/02-coding-guidelines/00-canonical-size-tier.md`:

| Metric | Limit | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| **Function body (preferred)** | <= 8 lines | warn |
| **Function body (hard cap)** | <= 15 lines | error (build fails) |
| **File length (standard max)** | <= 100 lines | error (coding lines) |
| **File length (recommended)** | <= 80 lines | info |
| **React component file** | <= 80–100 lines | error (max 100 lines) |
| **Struct / class** | <= 120 lines | error |
| **Nested `if` statements** | 0 (No nesting) | error (flatten with guard clauses) |
| **Function Parameters** | <= 3 parameters | error (use specialized helpers / structs) |
| **Line Endings** | LF (`\n`) only | error (CRLF auto-rejected) |
| **File Encoding** | UTF-8 (no BOM) | error (BOM auto-rejected) |
| **Double Blank Lines** | 0 (Banned) | error (normalize to 1 blank line) |

## Continuous 2-Phase Self-Loop & 2-Agent Concurrency Architecture

To guarantee full execution without stopping after planning mode, the master orchestrator MUST enforce this continuous 2-phase loop:

### 1. 2-Agent Concurrency & Strict `.lovable/` Bounding

- **2-Agent Limit (Max 2 Threads Each):** When dispatching work, spawn **at most 2 sub-agents concurrently**, with **no more than 2 threads per agent**.
- **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** Subagents can ONLY write planning files, subtasks, status reports, and logs inside `.lovable/` (`.lovable/plans/`, `.lovable/temp/active-locks.json`, `.lovable/memory/issues/`).
- **Context Diet:** Provide subagents with minimal instructions (e.g. "Read subtask file `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX/01-task.md` and execute it"). Do not paste huge files into agent prompts.

### 2. Phase 1: Planning Mode & Subtask Generation (Steps 1 .. N/2)

- Spawn 2 planning subagents to scan the codebase for target guideline violations.
- Write the master architectural specification in `.lovable/plans/pending/XX-audit.md` with an exhaustive Violation Ledger table.
- Decompose the master plan into granular subtasks in `.lovable/plans/subtasks/XX/01-task.md`, `02-task.md`, etc.
- **MANDATORY AUTO-LOOP (DO NOT STOP):** Once Phase 1 planning completes, the master orchestrator **MUST NOT STOP or ask the user for confirmation**. It MUST immediately self-loop and transition directly into Phase 2 execution mode.

### 3. Phase 2: Execution Mode & Parallel Refactoring (Steps N/2+1 .. N)

- Spawn 2 execution subagents (max 2 threads each) to execute subtasks in parallel on disjoint files.
- Subagents refactor code following all coding guidelines (<= 8–15 line functions, single return types, universal `*AppError` wrapping, Unix LF line endings).
- Move completed subtasks from `.lovable/plans/subtasks/` to `.lovable/plans/completed/` and update `.lovable/plans/index.md`.
- **Failure Memory & Feedback Loop:** If a subagent fails:
  - Rollback dirty working tree and log error details to `.lovable/plans/last-failure.md` and `.lovable/memory/issues/XX-failure.md`.
  - The next subagent spawned MUST read the previous failure log first, record it as a pending memory task, and implement the necessary fix.
- Execute local linters and `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` ensuring `exit 0` before concluding.

## Strict In-Repository Execution & `.lovable/` Bounding Mandate

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRICT IN-REPOSITORY EXECUTION & `.lovable/` STORAGE CONTRACT:**
>
> 1. **In-Codebase Execution Only:** Whenever a Python script (runner, autofixer, linter, test aggregator) is executed or created, it MUST be executed **strictly within the repository root** (current working directory), NEVER outside the codebase or against external arbitrary directories.
> 2. **Strict Folder Bounding (`.lovable/`):** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, helper utilities, memory issue logs, and planning files MUST be created inside the `.lovable/` folder:
>    - Python AI Scripts: `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/` (e.g. `01-file-manipulator.py`, `02-guideline-autofixer.py`, `03-cicd-local-runner.py`, `04-relative-path-fixer.py`, `05-naming-autofixer.py`).
>    - RCA & Issue Logs: `.lovable/memory/issues/` and `.lovable/cicd-issues/`.
>    - Execution Plans & Subtasks: `.lovable/plans/pending/`, `.lovable/plans/subtasks/`.
>    - Coding Guidelines Mirror: `.lovable/coding-guidelines/`.
> 3. **Worker Pool & Log Aggregation Architecture:** All local runners and test orchestrators must use a concurrent worker pool (2–3 workers via `ThreadPoolExecutor`), announce enqueued tasks upfront, show real-time progress, handle failures gracefully without cancelling sibling workers, and print a consolidated final summary with full stdout/stderr error logs for failed jobs.
> 4. **`force` Keyword Support:** If the user wrote `force`, `force rebuild`, or `force create` on top of the prompt or trigger: **ALWAYS recreate/regenerate the Python runner script from scratch**, regardless of whether the file already exists on disk.
> 5. **No External or Random File Creation:** NEVER write scripts, temporary test scripts, or scratch files to root, `/tmp`, global system paths, or outside the repository boundary.

## AI Fix Scripts Memory (Reusable Tooling)

- [ ] `/goal` **Reuse First:** I have rigorously scanned and `/learn`ed `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` to check if a helper script already exists before writing any new temporary code.
- [ ] **Strict In-Repository Execution:** All Python scripts (`.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/*.py`) MUST be executed strictly within the codebase repository root, NEVER outside the codebase.
- [ ] **Strict .lovable/ Folder Storage:** All AI scripts, local runners, autofixers, and helper utilities MUST be created inside `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/`. NEVER create scripts in root or external paths.
- [ ] **Automated File & Hygiene Fixer:** Use `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/01-file-manipulator.py` and `02-guideline-autofixer.py` to normalize LF endings, remove trailing whitespace, and fix file size boundaries.
- [ ] **Go Generate Sync:** If you modify Go constants, enums, or stringers, you MUST run `go generate ./...` in the relevant directory (e.g., `cd gitmap && go generate ./...`) and commit the resulting generated files to prevent CI drift.
- [ ] **Commit & Track:** All new helper scripts were written strictly to `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/` and committed to Git for future reuse.
- [ ] **Index Documentation:** I have updated `.lovable/ai-fix-scripts/index.md` using sequential script naming (e.g., `01-file-manipulator.py`). For every script, I have included a `<details>` collapsible tag explaining exactly why the script is there and what it does.

## Pre-Reply / Loop Checklist (Must Verify Every Loop Iteration)

- [ ] Git working tree is clean before new code changes.
- [ ] Sub-agents are actively assigned disjoint files verified against `.lovable/temp/active-locks.json`.
- [ ] Completed tasks were `mv`'d to `plans/completed/` and `plans/index.md` was updated.
- [ ] 3-strike rule respected: failed tasks cleanly rolled back and logged to `last-failure.md`.
- [ ] **Strict Relative Git Paths:** All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask references in plans, specs, and memory logs are strictly relative to the git repository root. Zero absolute paths (`D:\...`, `C:\...`) or `file:///` URIs.
- [ ] **LF Line Endings (`\n`):** All files use Unix LF line endings. Zero CRLF (`\r\n`).
- [ ] **UTF-8 Encoding (No BOM):** All files encoded in UTF-8 without BOM.
- [ ] **Single Trailing Newline:** Every file ends with exactly one terminating newline (`\n`).
- [ ] **No Function Starts with Blank Line:** Functions start immediately on line 1 with code.
- [ ] **Zero Double Blank Lines:** No `\n\n\n` in code or markdown.
- [ ] **Markdown Heading Spacing:** Exactly one blank line before and after headings (no leading blank line on line 1).
- [ ] **File Size Caps:** All files <= 100 coding lines (recommended <= 80 lines).
- [ ] **Function Sizing:** All functions <= 8 lines preferred (hard cap 15 lines).
- [ ] Coding Guidelines & Master Consolidated File: I have fully read, checked, and strictly enforced every file in `spec/02-coding-guidelines/`, as well as the master consolidated coding guideline file at `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md`.


1. [ ] /learn and apply as a /goal `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md` and also make sure the agent rules are created in the repo to read in the future quickly.

- [ ] `python linter-scripts/check-file-sizes.py` and `python linter-scripts/check-newline-styling.py` exited with code 0.
- [ ] Local CI runner `python .lovable/ai-fix-scripts/03-cicd-local-runner.py` exited with code 0.

## Non-Negotiable Coding Guidelines Checklist (Auto-Reject on Violation)

/goal You MUST verify every item on this checklist before committing any code. If a subagent violated one of these rules, you must reject their work.

- [ ] Strict Relative Git Paths: All file paths, markdown links, citations, and subtask references in plans, specs, and memory logs are strictly relative to the git repository root. Zero absolute paths or `file:///` URIs.
- [ ] Master Guidelines: I have fully read and strictly enforced `spec/02-coding-guidelines/00-canonical-size-tier.md`, `spec/02-coding-guidelines/08-file-folder-naming/`, and `.lovable/coding-guidelines/coding-guidelines.md`.
- [ ] LF Line Endings & UTF-8 (No BOM): Verified Unix LF and UTF-8 across all files.
- [ ] Zero Double Blank Lines: Zero `\n\n\n` in code and markdown files.


1. [ ] /learn the section as a /goal [AI Fix Scripts Memory](#ai-fix-scripts-memory)

- [ ] Action Summary: I have output a detailed `- [x]` checklist summarizing exactly what I accomplished this turn to prove I did not hallucinate.
